## Dynamic forms

this repository is about creating form based on json file.

I am using `antd` as a main component provider for forms.

So when you want to change something in the form you just modify the json file this code will automatically parse that file into the form. and ther is a dynamic table as well where you can create delete and edit data structure that you just created.

### How to use this code
`src/components/forms/data.js`

change the `formSchema` this json and you are good to go.



PRs are always welcomed!
